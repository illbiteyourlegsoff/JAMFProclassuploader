# JAMFProclassuploader

To build Classes in jamf pro for Apple Classroom

This is a uploader to Associate Students to their iPad, add the students to a Static group, Build the class by the teacher, and static group to the class, and add any additional Teachers. This uses jamf pro API REST. It was designed for schools not using Managed Apple IDs. 

This was originally built using AppleScript for App portability. This version is BASH. If you want applescript version let me know.
